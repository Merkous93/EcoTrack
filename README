## **Introduction**

EcoTrack helps users calculate their carbon footprint based on inputted daily activities, such as driving, electricity usage, and other personal habits. The app provides personalized recommendations to help users reduce their carbon emissions and track their progress over time.

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/Merkous93/EcoTrack.git
   cd EcoTrack
   \`\`\`

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Start the application:**

   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

## **Usage**

After starting the application, use the provided interface to enter your daily activities. The app will calculate your carbon footprint and offer suggestions on how to reduce it. The user can view their historical data and monitor their progress over time.

## **Features**

- User-friendly form to input daily activities and energy usage
- Real-time carbon footprint calculation based on user input
- Personalized tips and suggestions for reducing carbon emissions
- Historical data tracking for monitoring progress
- Data visualization to display carbon footprint trends over time

## **Technologies Used**

- **Front-End:** React.js for building a dynamic and responsive user interface
- **Back-End:** Node.js with Express for handling API requests and server-side logic
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data and carbon footprint calculations
- **APIs:** Integration with third-party APIs for retrieving real-time emission factors
- **Testing:** Jest and Mocha for unit and integration testing

## **Challenges**

- **Technical Challenges:** Setting up the development environment and integrating multiple libraries caused initial delays. Optimizing the API for performance was also challenging, requiring efficient data handling and caching.
- **Non-Technical Challenges:** Balancing time between the project and other commitments was difficult. Improved time management strategies and setting clear daily goals helped mitigate this challenge.
